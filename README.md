# Lesson Learned Hosting The Fediverse: A SpaceHost Story

NOTE: This article is a written adaptation of the presentation I delivered at the **Fediverse House** during **SXSW 2025**.

Hello everyone.

I only have **15 minutes** for _this presentation (including questions) â€”  so, let's get started.

**Thank you** for attending the **Developer Meetup** at the **Fediverse House** at **SXSW 2025**.

And, thank you **Evan Prodromou** for letting me present.
