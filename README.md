# A Lesson Learned From Hosting The Fediverse: A SpaceHost Story

NOTE: This article is a written adaptation of the presentation I delivered at the **Fediverse House** during **SXSW 2025**.

Hello everyone.

I only have **15 minutes** for _this presentation_ (including questions) â€”  so, let's get started.

**Thank you** for attending the **Developer Meetup** at the **Fediverse House** at **SXSW 2025**.

And, thank you **Evan Prodromou** for letting me present.

-----

I think â€” most _good_ presentations _tell a story_.
So, I am going to _tell a story_.

This is an **exciting story** about â€”

Our experience with **hosting the Fediverse** at [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/).

* What we first tried.
* How & why that failed.
* How we solved this problem.
* And, how we are going to solve this _even better_.

If **you** _care_ about the Fediverse, then â€“ **this is _a story for you_**.

But â€” a story needs a _beginning_.

So, I will start with an _introduction_.

-----

I am Charles Iliya Krempeaux.

I have been:

* a **product** leader,
* an **engineering** leader, and
* a **founder**.

Because we a short on time â€“ _here is_ just one _highlight_ from my career:

I was **one of the first engineers** at the **social-media** company **Hootsuite**.
Hootsuite was at one time **the most popular Twitter app** in the world.
Later, it _also_ became a Facebook, Instagram, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, and everything else social-media app.

I have _been in Tech_ for â€” a long time.
Depending on _how you count it_ â€” _more-than_ 30 years.
And, I have **a lot** of **experience** with **social-media** from an **engineering**, **product**, **enterprise**, and **company** point-of-view.

-----

_Some of you_ might know _me_ from â€¦

-----

â€¦ The Fediverse!

This is my `@reiver@mastodon.social` account

Where I talk **a lot** about:

(...you guessed itâ€¦)

* **The Fediverse**

I ALSO talk about:

* other **decentralized social-media**

And, I talk about **the Fediverse related projects** I work on, too.

For exampleâ€¦

-----

â€¦ GreatApe!

**GreatApe** is a conversations platform for the Fediverse, and decentralized social-media.

-----

Here is an _example_ of _myself_ and `atomicpoet` (Chris Trottier) using Great Ape back in October 2023.

Here, we were using GreatApe to do a **live video podcast**.

Now, you don't see it in this image, but â€”

We can also _invite_ people _watching_ in the _audience_ to _join the video conversation_.

-----

_Another thing_ some people _might know me from_ is â€” [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/).

And, for _this story_ â€” **SpaceHost** is probably the _more important thing_ â€”

As it _partially motivates_ what I am _soon_ going to show you.

-----

**But, what is SpaceHost** â€”

We need to know this for the story.

**What is SpaceHost** â€”

To _regular people_, I tend to **describe SpaceHost as** â€”

> **SpaceHost is an _app-directory_ for the _Fediverse_**

Or maybe â€“-

> **SpaceHost is an _app-directory_ for the _decentralized social-media_**

To people who are a little more _tech savvy_ â€” I might describe SpaceHost as â€”

> **SpaceHost is _fully-managed hosting_ for _all the Fediverse_**

As far as I know â€“

* SpaceHost was **the second hosting-company in the Fediverse**, after Masto.Host, and
* SpaceHost is **the first hosting-company in the Fediverse to _try to_ offer _all the (other) Fediverse software other than Mastodon_** â€“  although, we _also offer Mastodon_.

-----

We _learned_ a number of things from _our experience_ with hosting so many peopleâ€™s _Fediverse servers_

Here is **_one thing_ we learned** â€”

-----

We learned what _seems to be the **number 1 cause** of Fediverse servers crashing_.

Before you read what that is â€“ take a guess at what you think it might be.
(Scroll down once you have your answer.)

Here is the answer â€”

**caching**

And, in particular â€”

**The _storage drive_ of _Fedivere servers filling-up_ â€“ due to _continued caching_**.

-----

Some of you might ask â€” 

* What is being CACHED?
* Some of you might even be ask, WHAT IS CACHING?

Those are both _good questions_ ðŸ™‚

**Caching** is a _technical term_ â€” in _computer science_, _computer hardware engineering_, and _software engineering_.
It basically means â€” **temporarily storing things**.

So _what_ is being _temporarily stored_?

-----

With _Fediverse servers_, they _temporarily store_ **user-data from other servers**.

* posts,
* media from posts,
* user-profile text,
* avatar images,
* header images,
* _and more_.

Now, _temporarily storing_ things (_caching_) is normal.

It is a _core technique_ with _computer programming_ & (other) _engineering_ â€“

Everything from **the CPU** to **the Web**, to **applications** all cache.
And, would _not_ work without caching.

So â€“

* _caching_ is _important_.
* _caching_ makes things _work_.

But â€“

* _caching_ is a _difficult_ to _do well_.

So â€“ it is _not_ surprising that _caching_ is _challenging_ for _Fediverse servers_ to do well.
