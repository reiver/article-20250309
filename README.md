# A Lesson Learned From Hosting The Fediverse: A SpaceHost Story

NOTE: This article is a written adaptation of the presentation I delivered at the **Fediverse House** during **SXSW 2025**.

Hello everyone.

I only have **15 minutes** for _this presentation (including questions) —  so, let's get started.

**Thank you** for attending the **Developer Meetup** at the **Fediverse House** at **SXSW 2025**.

And, thank you **Evan Prodromou** for letting me present.

-----

I think — most _good_ presentations _tell a story_.
So, I am going to _tell a story_.

This is an **exciting story** about —

Our experience with **hosting the Fediverse** at [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/).

* What we first tried.
* How & why that failed.
* How we solved this problem.
* And, how we are going to solve this _even better_.

If **you** _care_ about the Fediverse, then – **this is _a story for you_**.

But — a story needs a _beginning_.

So, I will start with an _introduction_.
