# A Lesson Learned From Hosting The Fediverse: A SpaceHost Story

NOTE: This article is a written adaptation of the presentation I delivered at the **Fediverse House** during **SXSW 2025**.

Hello everyone.

I only have **15 minutes** for _this presentation (including questions) —  so, let's get started.

**Thank you** for attending the **Developer Meetup** at the **Fediverse House** at **SXSW 2025**.

And, thank you **Evan Prodromou** for letting me present.

I think — most _good_ presentations _tell a story_.
So, I am going to _tell a story_.

This is an **exciting story** about —

Our experience with **hosting the Fediverse** at [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/).

* What we first tried.
* How & why that failed.
* How we solved this problem.
* And, how we are going to solve this _even better_.

If **you** _care_ about the Fediverse, then – **this is _a story for you_**.

But — a story needs a _beginning_.

So, I will start with an _introduction_.

-----

I am Charles Iliya Krempeaux.

I have been:

* a **product** leader,
* an **engineering** leader, and
* a **founder**.

Because we a short on time – _here is_ just one _highlight_ from my career:

I was **one of the first engineers** at the **social-media** company **Hootsuite**.
Hootsuite was at one time **the most popular Twitter app** in the world.
Later, it _also_ became a Facebook, Instagram, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, and everything else social-media app.

I have _been in Tech_ for — a long time.
Depending on _how you count it_ — _more-than_ 30 years.
And, I have **a lot** of **experience** with **social-media** from an **engineering**, **product**, **enterprise**, and **company** point-of-view.
