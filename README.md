# Hosting the Fediverse: The Unexpected Lesson from SpaceHost

The best presentations _tell a story_ ‚Äî this is a story of our journey **hosting the Fediverse** at [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one):

* What we tried first.
* How & why that failed.
* How we solved the problem.
* And, an unexpected _invention_ that could _reshape the Social Web_.

If you care about the Fediverse, then _this is a story for you_.

<mark>NOTE: This article is a written adaptation of the presentation I delivered at the **Fediverse House** during **SXSW 2025**.</mark>

But ‚Äî a story needs a _beginning_.
So, I will start with an _introduction_.

## Who Am I

<img src="charles-intro.png" style="width:400px;" />

I am **Charles Iliya Krempeaux**.

I have been a **product leader**, an **engineering leader**, and a **founder**.

But, let‚Äôs skip the long bio ‚Äî here is _just one_ highlight from my career:

**I was one of the first engineers** at **Hootsuite**
‚Äî
a **social-media** company which at one time **the most popular Twitter app** in the world.
Over time, Hootsuite expanded to _also_ became a **Facebook**, **Google+**, **Instagram**, **LinkedIn**, **TikTok**, **YouTube**, **WhatsApp**, and _every other social-media platform_ app.
Everyone from
the U.S. White House,
to IBM,
to tens-of-millions of people all over the world,
and 80% of fortune 1,000 companies
have used the tool I created with others.

I have _been in Tech_ for **_more-than_ 30 years**.

And, from **engineering**, to **product**, to **enterprise**, and to **company** ‚Äî I have **a lot** of **experience** with **social-media**.

## Me on the Fediverse

Some of you might know _me_ from ‚Ä¶

<img src="reiver-mastodon-social.png" style="width:400px;" />

‚Ä¶ The Fediverse!

This is my [`@reiver@mastodon.social`](https://mastodon.social/@reiver) account.

Where I talk **a lot** about ‚Äî _you guessed it_ ‚Äî **the Fediverse**.
I _also_ talk about ‚Äî other **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**) ‚Äî including **Bluesky**, **Farcaster**, **Nostr**, and others.

And, I talk about **the Fediverse related projects** I work on, too.
For example‚Ä¶

## GreatApe

<img src="greatape-logo.png" style="width:200px;" />

‚Ä¶ GreatApe!

**GreatApe** is a conversations platform for the Fediverse, and decentralized social-media.

<img src="greatape-screenshot.jpeg" style="width:400px;" />

Here is an _example_ of _myself_ and [`atomicpoet`](https://atomicpoet.org/@atomicpoet) (Chris Trottier) using GreatApe back in October 2023.

Here, we were using GreatApe to do a **live video podcast**.

Now, you don't see it in this image, but ‚Äî we can also _invite_ people _watching_ in the _audience_ to _join the video conversation_.

## SpaceHost

<img src="spacehost.png" style="width:400px;" />

_Another thing_ some people _might know me from_ is ‚Äî [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/).

And, for _this story_ ‚Äî **SpaceHost** is probably the _more important thing_ ‚Äî

As it _partially motivates_ what I am _soon_ going to show you.

## What Is SpaceHost

<img src="spacehost-2025.png" style="width:400px;" />

**But, what is SpaceHost** ‚Äî

We need to know this for the story.

**What is SpaceHost** ‚Äî

To _regular people_, I tend to **describe SpaceHost as** ‚Äî

> **SpaceHost is an _app-directory_ for the _Fediverse_**

Or maybe ‚Äì-

> **SpaceHost is an _app-directory_ for the _decentralized social-media_**

To people who are a little more _tech savvy_ ‚Äî I might describe SpaceHost as ‚Äî

> **SpaceHost is _fully-managed hosting_ for _all the Fediverse_**

As far as I know ‚Äì

* SpaceHost was **the second hosting-company in the Fediverse**, after Masto.Host, and
* SpaceHost is **the first hosting-company in the Fediverse to _try to_ offer _all the (other) Fediverse software other than Mastodon_** ‚Äì  although, we _also offer Mastodon_.

## What Crashes Fediverse Servers

We _learned_ a number of things from _our experience_ with hosting so many people‚Äôs _Fediverse servers_

Here is **_one thing_ we learned** ‚Äî

We learned what _seems to be the **number 1 cause** of Fediverse servers crashing_ ‚Äî including Mastodon, Misskey, Pixelfed, and every other type of Fediverse server.

Before you read what that is ‚Äì guess to yourself what _you think_ it might be.

(**Scroll down once you have your guess.**)

Here is the answer ‚Äî

**Caching**

And, in particular ‚Äî

**The _storage drive_ of _Fedivere servers filling-up_ ‚Äì due to _continued caching_**.

## Caching

Some of you might ask ‚Äî 

* **What is being _cached_**?
* Some of you might even be ask, **what is _caching_**?

Those are both _good questions_ üôÇ

**Caching** is a _technical term_ ‚Äî in _computer science_, _computer hardware engineering_, and _software engineering_.

It (caching) basically means ‚Äî **temporarily storing things**.

So, _what_ is being _temporarily stored_?

<img src="fediverse-caching.png" style="width:400px;" />

With _Fediverse servers_, they _temporarily store_ **user-data from other servers**.

* posts,
* media from posts,
* user-profile text,
* avatar images,
* header images,
* _and more_.

<img src="hard-problems-in-computer-programming.png" style="width:400px;" />

Now, _temporarily storing_ things (_caching_) is normal.

It (caching) is a _core technique_ with _computer programming_ & (other) _engineering_ ‚Äì

Everything from **the CPU** to **the Web**, to **applications** all cache.
And, would _not_ work without caching.

So ‚Äì _caching_ is _important_, _caching_ makes things _work_, but ‚Äì _caching_ is a _difficult_ to _do well_.

So ‚Äì it is _not_ surprising that _caching_ is _challenging_ for _Fediverse servers_ to do well.

## Round One

At SpaceHost we wrestled with this problem.

Should we _just automatically clear the cache_ for our customers?

Or, should we _tell them_ their _storage drive_ is filling up ‚Äì and, _let them decide_.

The challenge is ‚Äì _clearing the cache_ affects _user-experience_.
It can ‚Äúbreak‚Äù search.
It can also "break" the home-feed.

So ‚Äì

<img src="spacehost-email-alert.png" style="width:400px;" />

At first ‚Äì we decided to just _e-mail_ our _customers_ to _tell them_ that _their storage drives_ were _filling-up_ and _let then decide_.

What we found-out was that ‚Äì

**Most customers _seemed to never notice_ the _e-mail alert_ we sent them!**

In hindsight, that _was not_ a good strategy.

So ‚Äì

## Round Two

This was a problem!

It created a _bad experience_.

Their server got _slow_.
And sometimes _crashed_.

It doesn't matter if we sent them an e-mail or not.
It wasn't being noticed.
And, they were _unhappy_.

Which made us unhappy.
We wanted to fix this.
So ‚Äì

<img src="spacehost-chat-alert.png" style="width:400px;" />

We changed _our strategy_.

We started _automatically clearing_ our customers _caches_.

This is _better-than_ _servers crashing_, but ‚Äì there is still a problem ‚Äì

## Round Three

Search is _sort of_ _broken_ for them.

So ‚Äì

<img src="search-server.png" style="width:400px;" />

We need to _separate_ **search** from the **back-end server**.

We need to make it so **accumulating user-data** doesn‚Äôt **crash** the **back-end**. 

In fact ‚Äì multiple **back-end servers** could **share** the same **search server** to _reduce costs_.

We also need a **_Fediverse API_ for _search_**.

Here is the thing ‚Äì **we already built a lot of it**.

We started working on this back in August 2024.

In fact ‚Äì we start working on **search** plus **custom feeds** back in August 2024.

I didn‚Äôt mentioned **custom feeds** yet, but I am mentioning it now.

But back to **search** ‚Äì

## RobinLive

Because no **Fediverse software** uses this **search API** yet ‚Äì

We created a **real-time search-engine** so you can see it _in action_.

<img src="robinlive-example.png" style="width:400px;" />

You can try it for yourself at:

https://robin.live/

## Decentralized Search

<img src="decentralize-all-the-things.png" alt="Decentralize All The Things" style="width:400px;" />

Now, although [RobinLive](https://robin.live/) exists ‚Äì

The idea is that there would be _multiple_ **search servers**.

And, not just RobinLive.

That is right ‚Äì **let's decentralize them**.
**Let's decentralized search**.

RobinLive will be _one of many_.

## DeSo Search

<img src="robinlive-deso-search.png" style="width:400px;" />

If you were looking closely at the _previous_ RobinLive screen, you might have noticed that ‚Äì in addition to showing results from the Fediverse ‚Äì we were also showing results from Bluesky.

We on the Fediverse have more in common with those on _other decentralized social-networks_ than the _centralized ones_.
I don't think we are enemies.
I think we are all fellow-travelers.
We are all reacting to the same problems (with the Internet, the Web, and social-media) in a similar way ‚Äî we are just choosing different technologies.

I have my own opinions about the Tech.
I have my own preferences.
But ‚Äì

I want **the user** to **_not_ have to care about** _these differences_.

## All The DeSo Networks

I think [Danielle For√©](https://mastodon.online/@danirabbit) said it best ‚Äì

When talking about **the Fediverse** ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt say "_decentralized_", or "_open-source_", or "_server_", or even mention "_e-mail_".
She just said ‚Äì you can _follow anyone_ from ANY _social-network_.

**I want to make that __as true__ as I can.**

Thus ‚Äì users **should not care** about _the differences between_ ‚Äì the Fediverse, Bluesky, Nostr, and others.
