# Hosting the Fediverse: The Unexpected Lesson from SpaceHost

The best presentations _tell a story_ ‚Äî this is a story of our journey **hosting the Fediverse** at [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one):

* What we tried first.
* How & why that failed.
* How we solved the problem.
* And, an unexpected _invention_ that could _reshape the Social Web_.

If you care about the Fediverse, then _this is a story for you_.

<mark>NOTE: This article is a written adaptation of the presentation I delivered at the **Fediverse House** during **SXSW 2025**.</mark>

But ‚Äî a story needs a _beginning_.
So, I will start with an _introduction_.

## Who Am I

<img src="charles-intro.png" style="width:400px;" />

I am **Charles Iliya Krempeaux**.

I have been a **product leader**, an **engineering leader**, and a **founder**.

But, I will skip the _long bio_ ‚Äî here is _just one_ highlight from my career:

**I was one of the first engineers** at **Hootsuite**
‚Äî
a **social-media** company which at one time **the most popular Twitter app** in the world.
Over time, Hootsuite expanded to _also_ became a **Facebook**, **Google+**, **Instagram**, **LinkedIn**, **TikTok**, **YouTube**, **WhatsApp**, and _every other social-media platform_ app.
Everyone from
the U.S. White House,
to IBM,
to tens-of-millions of people all over the world,
and 80% of fortune 1,000 companies
have used the tool I created with others.

I have _been in Tech_ for **_more-than_ 30 years**.

And, from **engineering**, to **product**, to **enterprise**, and to **company** ‚Äî I have **a lot** of **experience** with **social-media**.

## Me on the Fediverse

<img src="reiver-mastodon-social.png" style="width:400px;" />

Some of you might know _me_ from ‚Äî **_The Fediverse_**!
From my [`@reiver@mastodon.social`](https://mastodon.social/@reiver) account.

Where I talk **a lot** about ‚Äî _you guessed it_ ‚Äî **the Fediverse**.
I _also_ talk about _other_ **decentralized social-media** (**DeSo**) ‚Äî including **Bluesky**, **Farcaster**, **Nostr**, and others.

And, I talk about **the Fediverse related projects** I work on, too.
For example‚Ä¶

## GreatApe

<img src="greatape-logo.png" style="width:200px;" />

‚Ä¶ GreatApe!

[GreatApe](http://greata.pe/) is a conversations platform for the Fediverse, and decentralized social-media.

<img src="greatape-screenshot.jpeg" style="width:400px;" />

Here is an _example_ of _myself_ and [`atomicpoet`](https://atomicpoet.org/@atomicpoet) (Chris Trottier) using GreatApe back in October 2023.

Here, we were using GreatApe to do a **live video podcast**.

Now, you don't see it in this image, but ‚Äî we can also _invite_ people _watching_ in the _audience_ to _join the video conversation_.

## SpaceHost

<img src="spacehost.png" style="width:400px;" />

_Another thing_ some people _might know me from_ is ‚Äî [SpaceHost](https://spacehost.one/).

And, for _this story_ ‚Äî **SpaceHost** is probably the _more important thing_ ‚Äî as it _partially motivates_ what I am _soon_ going to show you.

## What Is SpaceHost

<img src="spacehost-2025.png" style="width:400px;" />

**But, what is SpaceHost** ‚Äî

We need to know this for the story.

**What is SpaceHost** ‚Äî

To _regular people_, I tend to **describe SpaceHost as** ‚Äî

> **SpaceHost is an _app-directory_ for the _Fediverse_**

Or maybe ‚Äì-

> **SpaceHost is an _app-directory_ for the _decentralized social-media_**

To people who are a little more _tech savvy_ ‚Äî I might describe SpaceHost as ‚Äî

> **SpaceHost is _fully-managed hosting_ for _all the Fediverse_**

As far as I know ‚Äì

* SpaceHost was **the second hosting-company in the Fediverse**, after Masto.Host, and
* SpaceHost is **the first hosting-company in the Fediverse to _try to_ offer _all the (other) Fediverse software other than Mastodon_** ‚Äì  although, we _also offer Mastodon_.

## What Crashes Fediverse Servers

We _learned_ a number of things from _our experience_ with hosting so many people‚Äôs _Fediverse servers_.
Here is **_one thing_ we learned** ‚Äî

We learned what _seems to be the **number 1 cause** of Fediverse servers crashing_ ‚Äî including **Mastodon**, **Misskey**, **Pixelfed**, and every other type of Fediverse server.

Before you read what that is ‚Äì guess to yourself what _you think_ it might be.

(**Scroll down once you have your guess.**)

<img src="mastodon-lifting-a-dreamer.png" style="width:400px;" />

Here is the answer ‚Äî

**Caching**

And, in particular ‚Äî

**The _storage drive_ of _Fedivere servers filling-up_ ‚Äì due to _continued caching_**.

## Caching

Some of you might ask ‚Äî 

* **What is being _cached_**?
* Some of you might even be ask, **what is _caching_**?

Those are both _good questions_ üôÇ

**Caching** is a _technical term_ ‚Äî in _computer science_, _computer hardware engineering_, and _software engineering_.
It (caching) basically means ‚Äî **temporarily storing things**.

So, _what_ is being _temporarily stored_?

<img src="fediverse-caching.png" style="width:400px;" />

With _Fediverse servers_, they _temporarily store_ **user-data from other servers**.

* posts,
* media from posts,
* user-profile text,
* avatar images,
* header images,
* _and more_.

<img src="hard-problems-in-computer-programming.png" style="width:400px;" />

Now, _temporarily storing_ things (_caching_) is normal.

It (caching) is a _core technique_ with _computer programming_ & (other) _engineering_ ‚Äì

Everything from **the CPU** to **the Web**, to **applications** all cache.
And, would _not_ work without caching.

So ‚Äì _caching_ is _important_, _caching_ makes things _work_, but ‚Äì _caching_ is a _difficult_ to _do well_.

So ‚Äì it is _not_ surprising that _caching_ is _challenging_ for _Fediverse servers_ to do well.

## Round One

At SpaceHost we wrestled with this problem.

Should we _just automatically clear the cache_ for our customers?

Or, should we _tell them_ their _storage drive_ is filling up ‚Äì and, _let them decide_.

The challenge is ‚Äì _clearing the cache_ affects _user-experience_.
It can ‚Äúbreak‚Äù search.
It can also "break" the home-feed.

So ‚Äì

<img src="spacehost-email-alert.png" style="width:400px;" />

At first ‚Äì we decided to just _e-mail_ our _customers_ to _tell them_ that _their storage drives_ were _filling-up_ and _let then decide_.

What we found-out was that ‚Äì

**Most customers _seemed to never notice_ the _e-mail alert_ we sent them!**

In hindsight, that _was not_ a good strategy.

So ‚Äì

## Round Two

This was a problem!

It created a _bad experience_.

Their server got _slow_.
And sometimes _crashed_.

It doesn't matter if we sent them an e-mail or not.
It wasn't being noticed.
And, they were _unhappy_.

Which made us unhappy.
We wanted to fix this.
So ‚Äì

<img src="spacehost-chat-alert.png" style="width:400px;" />

We changed _our strategy_.

We started _automatically clearing_ our customers _caches_.

This is _better-than_ _servers crashing_, but ‚Äì there is still a problem ‚Äì

## Round Three

Search is _sort of_ _broken_ for them.

So ‚Äì

<img src="search-server.png" style="width:400px;" />

We need to _separate_ **search** from the **back-end server**.

We need to make it so **accumulating user-data** doesn‚Äôt **crash** the **back-end**. 

In fact ‚Äì multiple **back-end servers** could **share** the same **search-server** to _reduce costs_.

We also need a **_Fediverse API_ for _search_**.
(More on that in a future article.)

Here is the thing ‚Äì **we already built a lot of it**.

We started working on this back in August 2024.

In fact ‚Äì we start working on **search** plus **custom feeds** back in August 2024.

I didn‚Äôt mentioned **custom feeds** yet, but I am mentioning it now.

But back to **search** ‚Äì

## RobinLive

Because no **Fediverse software** uses this **search API** yet ‚Äì

We created a **real-time search-engine** (named [RobinLive](https://robin.live/)) so you can see it _in action_.

<img src="robinlive-example.png" style="width:400px;" />

You can try it for yourself at:

https://robin.live/

## Decentralized Search

<img src="decentralize-all-the-things.png" alt="Decentralize All The Things" style="width:400px;" />

Now, although [RobinLive](https://robin.live/) exists ‚Äì the idea is that there would be _multiple_ **search-servers**.

And, not just RobinLive.

That is right ‚Äì **let's decentralize them**.
**Let's decentralize search**!

RobinLive will be _one of many_.

**It is difficult to overstate the significance _decentralized search_**
‚Äì
not only for the Social Web but for the (classical) Web and the Internet as a whole.
Decentralization will be just as transformative for _search_ and the Web as it has been for social-media.

## DeSo Search

<img src="robinlive-deso-search.png" style="width:400px;" />

If you were looking closely at the _previous_ RobinLive screen, you might have noticed that ‚Äì in addition to showing results from the Fediverse ‚Äì we were also showing results from Bluesky.

We on the Fediverse have more in common with those on _other decentralized social-networks_ than the _centralized ones_.
I don't think we are enemies.
I think we are all fellow-travelers.
We are all reacting to the same problems (with the Internet, the Web, and social-media) in a similar way ‚Äî we are just choosing different technologies.

I have my own opinions about the Tech.
I have my own preferences.
But ‚Äì

I want **the user** to **_not_ have to care about** _these differences_.

## All The DeSo Networks

<img src="danirabbit-post.jpeg" style="width:400px;" />

I think [Danielle For√©](https://mastodon.online/@danirabbit) [said it](https://mastodon.online/@danirabbit/113919277314661343) best ‚Äì

When talking about **the Fediverse** ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt say "_decentralized_", or "_open-source_", or "_server_", or even mention "_e-mail_".
She just said ‚Äì

> you can _follow anyone_ from any _social-network_.

**I want to make that _as true_ as I can.**

Thus ‚Äì users **should not care** about _the differences between_ ‚Äì the Fediverse, Bluesky, Nostr, and others.

## Custom Feeds

I also mentioned ‚Äì **custom feeds**.

I have been _talking about_ and _meme'ing about_ **Fediverse custom feeds** for a while ‚Äì and thinking about them _even longer_.

<img src="custom-feeds.png" style="width:400px;" />

And, guess what ‚Äì we already built a lot of that, too.

In fact ‚Äî the technology for **real-time search** and **custom feeds** are related.

## What Are Feeds

<img src="mastodon-custom-feeds.png" style="width:400px;" />

The **feed** most people are probably familiar with is ‚Äì the **home-feed**.

On **Mastodon**, the _home-feed_ uses a **simple algorithm** ‚Äì **reverse chron**.
This (_reverse chron_) is what some people _inaccurately_ call "**_no algorithm_**".

A **custom feed** lets you pick an **_alternative_ algorithm** to this.
For example ‚Äì

What if you wanted a _feed_ that ‚Äì _only showed_ posts from _people you follow_ _who do not post very often_.
(This was a 3rd party app for Twitter decades ago.)

What if you are a parent and want a _feed_ for you child that ‚Äì shows posts from the people your child follows, but ‚Äì removes all posts that contain pornographic images.

What if you want a _feed_ ‚Äì that _only shows_ posts from _mutuals_.

What if you are a cat lover and follow a bunch of (other) people who post photos of cats but also post stuff unrelated to cats that you do not care about, and want a _feed_ that ‚Äì _only shows_ posts from the _people you follow_ that includes a photo of a cat.

What if you are a scholar, and you want a _feed_ that _only shows_ scholarly papers shared by people you follow.

What if you use your community as a human-powered recommendation engine, and want a feed that ‚Äì shows popular posts and links drawn from the various communities you are in.

Etc.

## RobinFeed

<img src="robinfeed-01.png" style="width:400px;" />

This is [RobinFeed](https://robinfeed.com/) ‚Äì **RobinFeed** is a **custom feed generator**.

RobinFeed actually already has users ‚Äî people are already using RobinFeed!

Here (in the previous screenshot) are RobinFeed‚Äôs _current_ choices for creating a **custom feed**.
(More options will be available in the future.)

There is a saying:

> Show, don't tell.

So I am going to show you some of what RobinFeed is like ‚Äì if you were to choose the `"By Search Terms"` button (in the previous screenshot), you would then see the following ‚Äì

<img src="robinfeed-02.png" style="width:400px;" />

Here (in this screenshot), RobinFeed lets you choose what **search terms** you want to base your **custom feed** on.
(Again, there are other ways of creating a _custom feed_, but ‚Äî in this demo I am taking you through just one of them.)

I can fill this form in as follows (in the following screenshot) to get the following ‚Äì

<img src="robinfeed-03.png" style="width:400px;" />

Here I am just made making RobinFeed search for `"fediverse house"`.

I can also **filter-out** things by choosing `"Ad Filter"` ‚Äì

<img src="robinfeed-04.png" style="width:400px;" />

But, I will leave that empty _for this demo_.

(BTW, one upcoming filter we plan to add to RobinFeed is ‚Äî the ability to detect and filter-out pornographic images. Something that can help people create both _child-safer_ and _work-safer_ feeds.)

## Bluesky Custom Feeds

<img src="robinfeed-preview.png" style="width:400px;" />

We turned the _Fediverse results_ in [RobinFeed](https://robinfeed.com/) off, _just for now_.

Pressing the _preview_ button currently only shows results from Bluesky.
(Although, by the time most people read this, **RobinFeed** **Fediverse custom feeds** may have been turned back on.)

Again ‚Äì Fediverse results are in the system.
You can see them in the real-time search-engine ‚Äì [RobinLive](https://robin.live/)

But ‚Äì

## Fediverse Custom Feeds

Before the Fediverse can have its own **custom feeds**, we need something from Fediverse developers ‚Äì from the people who build the Fediverse.

The Fediverse needs front-end application support for **Fediverse custom feeds**, as a user-experience.
The Fediverse needs front-end application support for ActivtyPub `"Feed"` sub-actor-type (of `"Application"`), as a way of encoding Fediverse custom feeds.

Which means ‚Äì I have _more_ work to do, and I need to have more conversations with more Fediverse developers, to make this happen.

And ‚Äì I will end this here.

## Thank You

Thank you for reading all of that.
To summarize:

You can try the real-time search-engine at:

* https://robin.live/

Hopefully, there will eventually be other search-engines like it ‚Äì so that we can **decentralize search**.

And ‚Äì although _more work needs to be done_ to support _Fediverse custom feeds_ ‚Äì

You can try out the **custom feed generator** at:

* https://robinfeed.com/

And ‚Äì if you want to take a look at what motivated this story ‚Äì you can give **SpaceHost** a try at:

* https://spacehost.one/

If you would like to _talk to me more_ about any of this, or just want to _follow along_ ‚Äì you can **follow me at** ‚Äì
